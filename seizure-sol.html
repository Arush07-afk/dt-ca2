                        <h3>Protect the person's head</h3>
                        <p>Some seizures may cause the person to hit their head against the floor repeatedly. If their head is striking the floor or an object, protect their head with something soft, like a pillow, cushion, or jacket.
                            <p>Do not restrain their head or any other part of their body.</p></p>

                        <h3> Time the duration of the seizure</h3>
                        <p>If someone near you has a seizure, you should try to time the length of the seizure. Seizures generally last between 60 to 120 seconds (one to two minutes). Seizures that last longer than that can indicate a bigger problem, and you should call emergency services.</p>

                        <h3>Call emergency services unless the person commonly has seizures.</h3>
                        <p> If you know that someone has a history of seizures, then you do not need to call emergency services unless the seizure lasts for more than 2-5 minutes or if there is something different about this seizure.However, if a person is having a seizure for the first time or if you are unsure, you should call an ambulance immediately.</p>

                        <h3>Write down any details</h3>
                        <p>As soon as you get the chance, make a note of the details surrounding the seizure. This can be extremely valuable to the person who had the seizure, as well as to their doctor. Write down any of the following information:

                            <p>Part of the body the seizure started in</p>
                            <p>Parts of the body affected</p>
                        </p>
