                        <h3>Immobilize the Broken Bone</h3>
                        <p>After the injured person is stabilized, it's time to immobilize the broken bone if you anticipate a wait of an hour or longer for emergency medical personnel. Immobilizing it can help reduce the pain and protect the broken bone from further injury caused by inadvertent movement.</p>

                        <h3>Apply ice to the injury</h3>
                        <p> Once the broken bone is immobilized, apply something cold (preferably ice) to it as soon as you can while you wait for the ambulance. Cold therapy has many benefits, including numbing the pain, reducing inflammation / swelling and reducing bleeding by causing the arteries to constrict</p>

                        <h3>Keep calm and watch for signs of shock</h3>
                        <p>Breaking a bone is very traumatic and painful. Fear, panic, and shock are all common reactions, but they can have negative consequences for the body, so they must be controlled. As such, calm yourself and/or the injured person by reassuring him that help is on the way and the situation is under control.</p>

                        <h3>Consider Pain Medication</h3>
                        <p>If the wait for emergency medical personnel is longer than an hour (or you anticipate it being a long wait), then consider taking / giving some medication, if you have any, to control the pain and make the wait more tolerable.</p>
